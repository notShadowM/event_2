# Events Exercises

The aim of this exercise is to let you use your DOM events ('click', 'change') understanding to do some DOM manipulation.
Remember to always use `console.log` to understand how things work.

 - Add the necessary code to change the color of `#pallete` div Randomly:
   - Clicking `choose random color` should choose a random color from `colors` array in `js/index.js` and apply it to the `#pallete` background-color.
   > look for how to manipulate the style of a DOM element.
   
   > [this](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp) may help with the getting the random index.

 - Add the necessary code to change the color of `#pallete` div based on the `#color` input value:
   - When the user type `a hexa color code` inside `#color` input, should apply the color to the `#pallete` background-color.
   > look for `change` or `input` event and how it's used and choose what suits you best, also remember to find a way to get the value that the user type inside the `input`, ```console.log(event.target);``` may help you.

 - Extra:
   - Also apply the color to the input font when the use type a hexa color isnide the `input`.
   - Insert the random hexa color code inside the `input` programaticly when the user click on `choose random color`.
